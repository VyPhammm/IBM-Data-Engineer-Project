# IBM-Data-Engineer-Project Project

## Introduction 

In this project, I will:
1) Design a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. 
2) Design and implement a data warehouse and generate reports from the data. 
3) Design a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business. 
4) Extract data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, transform it and load it into the data warehouse. 
5) Create an ETL pipeline. 
6) Finally, create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model.

I am going to use different technologies such as Python, MySQL, NoSQL, Apache Airflow , Apache Spark.

## Task To perform:

1/ Set up the Database
  + Design the OLTP database
  + Populate the OLTP database with the provided data
  + Load the daily incremental data into the data warehouse
 
 2/ Set up the Data Repository
  + Set up NoSQL to store data
  + Load data into NoSQL
  + Query data in NoSQL database
 
 3/ Build the Data Warehouse
  + Design the schema for a data warehouse
  + Create the schema and load the data into fact and dimension tables
  + Automate the daily incremental data
  + Create Cubes and Rollups
 
 4/ Data Analytics-Create a Dashboard
  + Create a Cognos data source
  + Create a bar chart
  + Create a pie chart
  + Create a line chart
 
 5/ Create an ETL Pipeline with Airflow
  + Extract data from OLTP, NoSQL, and MongoDB databases
  + Transform OLTP data
  + Load transformed data
 
 6/ Cretae a Spark connection & ML model
  + Create a Spqrk connection to the data warehouse
  + Deploy a machine learning model on SparkML

## Finish
