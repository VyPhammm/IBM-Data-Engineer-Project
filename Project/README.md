# IBM Data Engineer Project

## Introduction 

In this project, I will assume the role of an Associate Data Engineer who has recently joined an e-commerce organization. I will be presented with a business challenge that requires building a data platform for retailer data analytics. 

I will:

Design a data platform that uses MySQL as an OLTP database and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Design and implement a data warehouse and generate reports from the data. Design a reporting dashboard that reflects the key metrics of the business. Extract data from OLTP and NoSQL databases, transform it and load it into the data warehouse, and then create an ETL pipeline. And finally, create a Spark connection to the data warehouse, and then deploy a machine learning model.

I am going to use different technologies such as Python, MySQL, NoSQL, Apache Airflow , Apache Spark.

## Task To perform:

1/ Set up the Database
  + Design the OLTP database
  + Populate the OLTP database with the provided data
  + Load the daily incremental data into the data warehouse
 
 2/ Set up the Data Repository
